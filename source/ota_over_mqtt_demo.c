/**
 * @file ota_over_mqtt_demo.c
 * @brief Over The Air Update demo using coreMQTT Agent.
 *
 * The file demonstrates how to perform Over The Air update using OTA agent and coreMQTT
 * library. It creates an OTA agent task which manages the OTA firmware update
 * for the device. The example also provides implementations to subscribe, publish,
 * and receive data from an MQTT broker. The implementation uses coreMQTT agent which manages
 * thread safety of the MQTT operations and allows OTA agent to share the same MQTT
 * broker connection with other tasks. OTA agent invokes the callback implementations to
 * publish job related control information, as well as receive chunks
 * of pre-signed firmware image from the MQTT broker.
